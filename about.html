						Hello, my name is Caul(pronounced like "call", short for Caulfield) Pearson. I'm currently majoring in computer science at Missouri State, and I'm set to graduate in May of 2020.  My primary interests are in web development, and I have experience with html(and pug), css and javascript.  I have also used web technologies such as express and angular in my work. In addition to traditional web development, I have also had experience in creating sites with Wordpress.
